# Arduino Project

## Overview
This project uses an Arduino board to [describe your project briefly, e.g., control LEDs, read sensor data, or automate a device]. It demonstrates basic Arduino programming, circuit connections, and sensor/actuator control.

---

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (Uno, Mega, or Nano)
- [List your sensors or actuators, e.g., LED, push button, temperature sensor, servo motor]
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- Power supply (if needed)

---

## Features
- [Feature 1, e.g., Blink LED at different intervals]
- [Feature 2, e.g., Read temperature and display on Serial Monitor]
- [Feature 3, e.g., Control motor speed using potentiometer]

---

## Wiring Instructions
1. Connect the components to the Arduino according to their pins:
   - [e.g., LED anode → pin 13, cathode → GND]
   - [e.g., Temperature sensor VCC → 5V, GND → GND, Data → A0]
2. Ensure proper power connections for all components.

---

## Installation
1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and load the `.ino` file.
4. Select the correct **board** and **port** from the Tools menu.
5. Click **Upload** to program the Arduino.

---

## Usage
- Open the Serial Monitor to view sensor readings (if applicable).
- Observe the connected components reacting according to the code.
- Modify the code to change behavior or add new functionality.

---

## Notes
- Ensure all components are connected correctly to avoid short circuits.
- Use appropriate resistors where needed (e.g., for LEDs).
- For advanced functionality, consider using libraries like [Servo.h], [DHT.h], or [Wire.h].
